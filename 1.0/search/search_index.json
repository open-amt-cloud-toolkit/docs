As an open source implementation, the toolkit makes it easier for IT departments and independent software vendors (ISVs) to adopt, integrate, and customize out-of-band management solutions for Intel vPro\u00ae platforms . Figure 1: Open AMT Cloud Toolkit features out-of-band (OOB) management. Goals \u00b6 The toolkit guide provides instructions to: Deploy the Management Presence Server (MPS) and Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) on the development system. Build and run Remote Provisioning Client (RPC) on the managed device. Connect the managed device (edge device) Additional sections provide guidance on the reference implementation UI Toolkit, REST API usage, asset security, and more. Figure 2: High-level architecture consists of four major software components. As shown in Figure 2, Open AMT Cloud Toolkit high-level architecture consists of four components: MPS - A microservice that uses an Intel vPro\u00ae platform feature, Client Initiated Remote Access (CIRA), for enabling edge, cloud devices to maintain a persistent connection for out-of-band manageability features, such as power control or Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) control. RPS - A microservice that activates Intel\u00ae AMT platforms using predefined profiles and connects them to the MPS for manageability use cases. RPC - A lightweight client application that communicates with the RPS server to activate Intel\u00ae AMT. UI Toolkit - A toolkit that includes prebuilt React components and a reference implementation web console. The React-based snippets simplify the task of adding complex manageability-related UI controls, such as the KVM, to a console. Integrate the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit into new and existing management consoles, software solutions, and more. Open AMT Cloud Toolkit Setup \u00b6 Build and Deploy Microservices Locally \u00b6 If unfamiliar with Docker*, choose this setup option to accomplish a manual, local installation of microservices. Get Started with Local Microservices Estimated completion time: Approximately 15 minutes Build and Deploy Microservices with Local Docker* Images \u00b6 If familiar with Docker, choose this setup option to install microservices as local Docker images. This option is an especially good choice for development systems with Docker already installed. Get Started with Microservices as Docker Images Estimated completion time: Approximately 15 minutes Both build-and-deploy options install microservices locally on a development system. The client application is installed on a managed device. Experienced Docker users may choose to deploy microservices straight to the cloud .

Additions \u00b6 RPS \u00b6 Configuration of CIRA on Intel\u00ae AMT managed devices: Enables managed devices to connect to the MPS. Un-configuration Intel\u00ae AMT devices: Removes all Intel\u00ae AMT configuration settings and resets Intel AMT to an *nprovisioned state. REST APIs: Includes Create, Read, Update, Delete AMT Profiles, Domain Profiles, and CIRA Profiles. RPC \u00b6 microLMS in the RPC executable: Eliminates the need to run a separate LMS when trying to configure Intel\u00ae AMT. CentOS*: Enables CentOS on RPC. Linux build environment is still Ubuntu* 18.04. Intel\u00ae AMT information commands: Provide feedback to the local command prompt showing status information of the Intel\u00ae AMT device. MPS \u00b6 REST APIs: Enables Intel\u00ae AMT Audit Log, Serial-Over-LAN features as well as functionality to toggle Intel\u00ae AMT Redirection Port, KVM Enable, and User Consent settings. UI Toolkit \u00b6 Profile Creator REACT module: Enables new RPS Profile APIs. Audit Log REACT module: Enables MPS Audit Log APIs. Serial-Over-LAN REACT module: Enables MPS Serial-Over-LAN APIs. KVM REACT module checkbox: Enables KVM. Checking this also enables Redirection Port. User Consent will be disabled if the Intel\u00ae AMT device is in Admin Control Mode (ACM). Modifications and Removals \u00b6 MPS \u00b6 Migration to Typescript from node.js : Modifies all REST APIs. Currently there are four end points which are categorized based on the functionality: /admin - for all the admin user operations like downloading mescript, root certificate, disconnected device, etc. /amt - for all AMT operations. /relay - for KVM operations. /notifications - for updating the device connections. Resolved Issues \u00b6 MPS \u00b6 Modified handling of APF protocol: Resolves issue in which multiple WS-Man* commands sent to Intel\u00ae AMT device in rapid succession cause a time-out error to be issued by Intel\u00ae AMT. Periodic power polling calls during KVM and SOL sessions: Resolves issue in which rapid keyboard inputs to Intel\u00ae AMT cause a hang on Intel\u00ae AMT 11 devices. Hangs can still occur, but system will become responsive again after the power poll (every 10 seconds). Known Defects in 1.0 \u00b6 Vault Deployment: Current docker build scripts deploy Vault in developer mode. When the Vault container is brought down in this mode, all data stored in Vault is lost. For production deployments, deploy Vault in production mode and follow best security practices for unsealing Vault and handling access to Vault. For details, see Hashicorp* Vault Deployment Guide . With Vault running in production mode, the data that RPS stores in Vault is retained when the container is brought down. Intel\u00ae AMT Connecting to MPS: After a successful configuration, Intel\u00ae AMT device will occasionally fail to connect to the MPS. In this situation there are two ways to prompt Intel\u00ae AMT to attempt to re-connect to MPS: Unplug and re-plug the network cable Reboot the Intel\u00ae AMT device Intel\u00ae AMT device fails to re-connect to MPS after MPS is not available for an extended period of time: If the MPS goes down for more than 2 days, Intel\u00ae AMT devices will no longer attempt to connect to MPS.

The MEI uses the ME Driver to talk to Intel AMT. By running RPC, we will activate Intel AMT into Client Control Mode (CCM), or ACM based on the created profile, as well as configure the CIRA connection of the AMT device to the MPS. After successfully running, the AMT device will be ready to be managed remotely using the web interface! Production Environment In a production environment, RPC can be deployed with an in-band manageability agent to distribute it to the fleet of AMT devices. The in-band manageability agent can invoke RPC to run and activate the AMT devices. Clone the Repository \u00b6 On your development system, navigate to a directory of your choice to clone and build RPC. Clone the RPC repository. git clone https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/rpc.git && cd rpc Install Prerequisites \u00b6 Windows Open 'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 20XX' as Administrator on your development system. This is NOT a regular Windows Command Prompt. This specific tool is used for compiling the RPC executable. Build VCPKG In the rpc directory, clone the Vcpkg repository. Vcpkg is a C/C++ Library Manager for Windows that was created by Microsoft. Find out more about it here . git clone --branch 2020 .01 https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git && cd vcpkg Build vcpkg.exe using the following command: bootstrap-vcpkg.bat Set up user-wide integration in order to allow Vcpkg to work with Visual Studio. vcpkg integrate install Build CPPRestSDK Make sure you are still in the ../vcpkg directory. Install the C++ REST SDK package using Vcpkg. C++ REST SDK is a library for cloud-based client-server communication with modern API design. Find out more about it here . Note This will take 15\u201325 minutes, depending on download speeds. vcpkg install cpprestsdk:x64-windows-static 3. Navigate back to the ./rpc directory cd .. Linux To install the required dependencies; enter the following command: sudo apt install git cmake build-essential libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-random-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev Build RPC \u00b6 Create a new directory called build within the ./rpc directory and change to it. mkdir build && cd build Run the following commands to build RPC. Windows Generate the CMake config cmake .. -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET = x64-windows-static -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE = ../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake Build the RPC executable cmake --build . --config Debug Change to Debug directory cd Debug Save the rpc.exe file to a flash drive or other means to transfer to the managed device. Linux cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug .. cmake --build . Save the new 'rpc' file in the Build directory to a flash drive or other means to transfer to the managed device. Run RPC to Activate and Connect the AMT Device \u00b6 Using a Flash Drive or other method, transfer the Debug folder to the managed device. On the managed device, run RPC with the following command to activate and configure Intel\u00ae AMT. It will take 1-2 minutes to finish provisioning the device. Replace [Development-IP-Address] with the development system's IP address, where the MPS and RPS servers are running Replace [profile-name] with your created profile from the Web Server. Windows rpc.exe -u wss://[Development-IP-Address]:8080 -c \"-t activate --profile [profile-name]\" Linux sudo ./rpc -u wss:// [ Development-IP-Address ] :8080 -c \"-t activate --profile [profile-name]\" Example Success Output: Production Environment In a production environment, an in-band agent would invoke this command with the parameters rather than a manual command.

In order for a client to securely perform actions on Intel&reg AMT devices using REST APIs, MPS uses secrets. There are six key assets that must be protected: Intel\u00ae AMT credentials Intel\u00ae MPS credentials Device Allowlisting (List of UUIDs) APIKey Server Configuration Web User Credentials In addition to the above assets, there are best practices that are recommened to help secure these assets as they are used within the system. The following sections will cover each asset and the recommended practices to use to protect the assets. Security Assets \u00b6 1. Intel\u00ae AMT credentials \u00b6 AMT credentials allows a user to remotely control Intel\u00ae AMT device and these credentials are configured in AMT Firmware. When user performs an action on the device using REST API, MPS then fetches corresponding credentials of that device from Vault/Database and uses it as part of digest authentication. It is highly recommended to use strong password (as per AMT password requirements) and also, unique passwords per device to make it more secure. 2. Intel\u00ae MPS credentials \u00b6 Every Intel\u00ae device needs to be authenticated prior to successful connection to MPS. MPS credentials are used to authenticate every Intel\u00ae device. After establishing TLS connection with MPS, device sends it's username and password, which will then be used to authenticate. It is highly recommended that every device use a unique username and password. 3. Device Allowlisting (List of UUIDs) \u00b6 Each Intel\u00ae AMT device has a unique identifier (UUID) assigned to it and this UUID is assigned by Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). As discussed above, devices are authenticated by MPS using MPS credentials. But even before validating credentials, only allowlisted Intel\u00ae AMT devices can be allowed to connect to make it more secure and this is being done using the allowlisted UUID. 4. APIKey \u00b6 Every client/user needs to be authenticated before allowing them to perform an action using REST API call. APIKey will be used by MPS to authenticate a client/user. 5. Server Configuration \u00b6 In order for MPS to use secure protocols, we will have to configure certificates, and the keys for these certificates need to be securely stored. If the keys are compromised then the attacker will be able to decrypt all the messages. 6. Web User Credentials \u00b6 Primary way of authenticating a user who intends to perform an action is using APIKey but MPS also provides a sample Web-based User Interface. This Web Interface shows how to make REST API calls using AJAX. Only authenticated users should be allowed to make REST API calls using Web UI and the authentication will be done using Web user credentials. Best Known Security Methods \u00b6 1. Enable TLS on network connections \u00b6 There are three potential places where TLS should be enabled to protect the security assets: HTTP/WS connection between client and MPS Connection between MPS and Vault/Database Connection between MPS and Intel\u00ae AMT device Encrypting these communication will help prevent network based attacks attempting to control Intel\u00ae AMT device. It is recommended that the most modern version of TLS be used to protect these connections. 2. Secure and isolate execution environment \u00b6 MPS holds the described security assets in memory during execution. In order to protect these assets while in memory of MPS, it is recommended that MPS be run in a secure execution environment such as a dedicated VM or container. Deploying into a hardened execution environment eases the burden of individually securing the assets. 3. Utilize Vault for storing Credentials \u00b6 Vault is a tool used to secure, store and tightly control access to secrets. Utilizing Vault to store passwords used by MPS will greatly increase the security of these assets. 4. Utilize Kubernetes Secrets for storing dynamic configuration values (like environment variables) \u00b6 Kubernetes Secrets help you to store and manage sensitive information like Tokens. Use Kubernetes secrets for storing environment variables required for configuring MPS rather than putting them in the image/pod. Vault token, Session secret key, and Server configuration assets required for MPS should be stored in Kubernetes secrets.","title":"Security Information"},{"location":"Microservices/MPS/securityMPS/#mps-security-considerations","text":"Management Presence Server (MPS) is a cloud agnostic micro-service that enables Intel\u00ae AMT-based platforms connecting over the internet to connect securely to manageability consoles.

In this role, RPS uses and creates secrets that are required to be able to successfully activate and use Intel\u00ae AMT. There are four key assets that must be protected: Remote admin password for Intel\u00ae AMT Provisioning Certificate for each supported domain Password used to encrypt each Provisioning Certificate Device configuration information sent to Intel\u00ae AMT device In addition to the above assets, there are best practices that are recommened to help secure these assets as they are used within the system. The following sections will cover each asset and the recommended practices to use to protect the assets. Security Assets \u00b6 1 Remote Admin Password \u00b6 This password is what is configured in the Intel\u00ae AMT firmware that allows a remote user to remotely control the Intel\u00ae AMT device (power actions, remote desktop, remote terminal, etc). When RPS activates an Intel\u00ae AMT device, it sets this password in the Intel\u00ae AMT firmware. This password can either be statically set or can be randomly generated based on the profile defined by the user setting up RPS (covered in AMTConfigurations section). It is highly recommended to use randomly generated passwords as this will make each Intel\u00ae AMT device more secure by using unique passwords per device. RPS will only ever save the Remote Admin Password to a configured database connection. If a database connection is not configured, RPS will not use profiles that specify a randomly generated password. 2 Provisioning Certificate \u00b6 This certificate is unique per owned domain that has Intel\u00ae AMT devices located and RPS needs to provision. This certificate must be derived from a root certificate whose hash matches one of the trusted provisioning root certificate hashes that is listed in the Intel\u00ae AMT device firmware. Generally, the provisioning certificate is purchased from a trusted certificate authority (VeriSign, GoDaddy, Comodo, etc). The full list of supported CAs based on Intel\u00ae AMT version are listed here . This certificate must contain the leaf certificate, root certificate, and all of the intermediate certificates to form a complete certificate chain. Additionally, the certificate file must also include the private key for the certificate (.pfx format). The leaf certificate for the provisioning certificate must match the domain suffix that the Intel\u00ae AMT device is connected as specified by DHCP option 15 or the Truted DNS Suffix in the Management BIOS Extentions (MEBx). Matching this is one of the ways in which the Intel\u00ae AMT firmware establishes trust with RPS. RPS reads the location of the Provisioning Certificate from the configuration file and will then fetch the certificate when it is needed to activate an Intel\u00ae AMT device. RPS doesn't ever save or export the Provisioning Certificate anywhere. 3 Password used to encrypt Provisioning Certificate \u00b6 This is the password that is used to encrypt the provisioning certificate .pfx file that is discussed above. RPS uses this password to decrypt the provisioning certificate so that it can use the certificate components and the private key to activate Intel\u00ae AMT devices. RPS reads the password from the configuration file and will use it when it is needed to decrypt a provisioning certificate. RPS doesn't ever save or export the Provisioning Certficiate Password anywhere. 4 Device configuration information sent to Intel\u00ae AMT device \u00b6 This data is a set of information that Intel\u00ae AMT firmware will use to establish trust and then activate the Intel\u00ae AMT device. Contained in this information is the hashed remote admin password. It is important to protect this set of information while it is being used by RPS and while in transit to the Intel\u00ae AMT device. This set of information is not replayable and is specific for a given Intel\u00ae AMT device. Best Known Security Methods \u00b6 1 Enable TLS on network connections \u00b6 There are two potential places where TLS should be enable to protect the security assets: * WebSocket connection between RPS and Intel\u00ae AMT client * Database connection between RPS and storage database Encrypting these communication transports will help prevent network based attacks attempting to discover the Remote Admin Password for the Intel\u00ae AMT device.

By only having the hash value stored in the RPS configuration file ensures that these assets are protected while at rest. Additionally, RPS can encrypt the static or randomly generated Remote Admin Password prior to sending this information to the database, protecting this asset while at rest in an unencrypted database.","title":"Security Information"},{"location":"Microservices/RPS/securityRPS/#rps-security-considerations","text":"Remote Provision Service (RPS) is built to be a microservice that plays a component role in a larger set of services that makes up the device management software suite.

Since there are many database options available, RPS takes a flexible approach that allows a developer to implement a simple module in RPS that will allow RPS to then send data to the database implementation of choice. The following example uses MongoDB as the example database, but the same concepts could be used for other database implementations. Create a file called AmtDeviceMongoDbRepository.ts in the \\RPS_MicroServer\\src\\repositories folder This module will need to implement the MongoDB types from mongodb and ILogger, AMTDeviceDTO, and IAMTDeviceWriter from RPS. Below is an example of how this could be implemented: // we imported all types from mongodb driver, to use in code import { MongoClient , Client , Collection , InsertOneWriteOpResult } from 'mongodb' ; import { ILogger } from '../interfaces/ILogger' ; import { AMTDeviceDTO } from './dto/AmtDeviceDTO' ; import { IAMTDeviceWriter } from './interfaces/IAMTDeviceWriter' ; // that class only can be extended export class AmtDeviceMongoDbRepository implements IAMTDeviceWriter { private collection : Collection ; private client : Client ; private connectionString : string ; private databaseName : string ; private collectionName : string ; private logger : ILogger ; constructor ( logger : ILogger , connectionString : string , databaseName : string , collectionName : string ) { this . connectionString = connectionString ; this . databaseName = databaseName ; this . collectionName = collectionName ; this . logger = logger ; } async connect () { let connection = await MongoClient . connect ( this . connectionString , { useNewUrlParser : true }); let database = connection . db ( this . databaseName ); this . collection = database . collection ( this . collectionName ); } disconnect () { if ( this . client ) { this . client . disconnect (); } } public async insert ( device : AMTDeviceDTO ) : Promise < boolean > { try { if ( ! this . collection ) { await this . connect (); } let result : InsertOneWriteOpResult = await this . collection . insertOne ( device ); return !! result . result . ok ; } catch ( error ) { this . logger . error ( `exception inserting record: ${ JSON . stringify ( error ) } ` ); return false ; } } } Edit the file index.ts in \\RPS_MicroServer\\src\\ and import the implementation of database module. For example: import { AmtDeviceMongoDbRepository } from './repositories/AmtDeviceMongoDbRepository' ; Edit the file index.ts in \\RPS_MicroServer\\src\\ and set the amtDeviceWriter object to an instance of the repository (under configurator.isAMTDeviceWriterEnabled() located in line 35).

The code snippets simplify the task of adding complex manageability UI controls, such as the Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM). A sample web application, based on React.js, is provided for test and development. The tutorial outlines how to add various controls to the sample React web application provided. Developers can use the sample code below as a springboard for developing their own consoles. What You'll Need \u00b6 Hardware \u00b6 At minimum, to install and utilize the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit microservices, a network configuration must include: A development system with Windows 10 or Ubuntu 18.04 or newer At least one Intel\u00ae vPro device Software \u00b6 MPS , the Management Presence Server RPS , the Remote Provisioning Server Intel\u00ae vPro device, configured and connected to MPS Note Instructions on how to set up the MPS and RPS servers to connect a vPro device can be followed in the Local or Local Docker Build and Deploy Guides.

The MPS can continue to run while creating and running the app. In a Command Prompt or Terminal, go to your preferred development directory. Run the following commands to create sample React app named my-app . npx create-react-app my-app && cd my-app Add UI Toolkit \u00b6 Run the following command to add the UI Toolkit and install the required dependencies: npm install git+https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/ui-toolkit.git --save Run the following commands to start the web UI locally: npm start By default, React apps run on port 3000 . If port 3000 is already used by the MPS server or any other application, you'll be prompted to use another port. If this happens, enter 'Y'. Sample Output: ``` You can now view my-app in the browser. Local: http://localhost:3001 On Your Network: http://172.16.17.4:3001 ``` Note By default, React launches in your machine's default browser. However for best experience, navigate to the page using a Chromium based web browser. When you make changes, you do not need to stop the application and restart. It will update and refresh automatically as you make code changes. Add a Sample Control \u00b6 The following sections outline how to add controls. To use the code snippets provided, replace what is in the App.js file with the provided code snippet. Refresh the web browser after adding a control if it does not update automatically after a few seconds. Add Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) Redirection \u00b6 The code snippet below adds KVM control to the React application.
