!!! warning "Warning - Console in Beta Development"
    Console is currently under development. The current available tags for download are Beta version code. This could mean that certain features may not function yet, visual look and feel may change, or bugs/errors may occur. It is not recommended for use in Production deployments. Follow along our [Feature Backlog for future releases and feature updates](https://github.com/orgs/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/projects/10)

1. In the Console UI, navigate to the **Devices** page in the left-hand menu sidebar.

2. In the upper-right, select **Add a Device**.

    </figure>

3. Enter the **Hostname** of the device.

4. Choose a **Friendly Name** of your choice. This provides a more user-friendly way to refer to the device.

5. Enter **admin** as the **Username**.

6. Enter the **AMT Password** of the device set during activation.

7. For AMT devices configured to use TLS, select the **Use TLS** checkbox and **Allow Self-Signed Certificates** checkbox.

    ??? tip "Important - TLS Requirement for AMT 16.1 and newer devices"
        Starting with AMT 16.1, TLS is required. By default, the AMT device will come with a self-signed TLS certificate as part of the firmware. By selecting both the **Use TLS** and **Allow Self-Signed Certificates** checkboxes, AMT will utilize the built-in TLS certificate. *This is the recommended path for Getting Started as it requires less initial setup*.

        To use a different TLS certificate, such as a 3rd party CA signed certificate, Enterprise Assistant is required. See the [Enterprise Assistant Overview](../../Reference/EA/overview.md) and [Enterprise Assistant TLS Configuration with RPC-Go](../../Reference/EA/RPCConfiguration/localtlsconfig.md) documentation for additional details.

    !!! note "Note - Not Sure of the AMT Version?"
        If the AMT version is not known, the RPC-Go `amtinfo` command can be used. This will print out the device's AMT version as part of the response.

        ```
        rpc amtinfo
        ```

8. Click **Submit**.
